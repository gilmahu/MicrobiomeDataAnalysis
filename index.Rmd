This site serves as dry-lab material for the course 2 weeks PhD  _Microbiome analysis using 2nd and 3rd generation DNA sequencing + multivariate data analysis_. Here you will find content on statistical data analysis of amplicon-seq microbiome data including preprocessing, descriptives, univariate- and multivariate statistical modelling ending with comparison additional layers of omics data. 

We heavily draw on the great work of the authors of phyloseq and metagenomeseq.
